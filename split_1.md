# Last mile operations quotes 

Transcripts 

Right. I can't often move. 

Hi I'm a student in the last mile operations. Yeah, any new? For the last. Mile in terms of. Phasing is faster and and. 

Any new what, Sir? 

I like the. Design encounter sometimes. And for that last e-mail that I've had. Are there any ways? 

So in terms of in. Terms of like like in you mean in terms of? Like live traffic data or. So our our our model will be trained on. Averages of traffic. If you mean in terms of live disruptions. Because because how the model will run. At a static. Moment in time, and then the A delivery driver, for instance, will be given a sequence of. Orders or deliveries that they're going. To go and do the model. Won't know because it's. Already been run at that time? 

There's been a. 

Car crash or haha so in that sense, no. Although you can you. Could run it like you. 

So yeah, it was. It works with mapping layers, so different levels of mapper layer which you can tell like temporary Rd. closures, but it also then works. 

Oh, I see. 

It's the order of roots rather than. This like propagation say. 

Oh, I see. It's more like the design using layers for capturing different features of the weight. 

But it's not traditionally typically it's not done live. So then you did suddenly. 

Have a road closure. 

It it wouldn't know that because it's already. Been run in the. So for instance, like a lot of. The companies we work with, they might. Getting deliveries take all the delivery orders and. Then at 11:00 PM. Run the algorithm the algorithm. Will provide information with the drive in terms of what's the order of delivery is going to be the same, but then whilst they're out of room, if there is a road closure, the model wouldn't have known that to knowing. 

I say I say. Have you seen some movies being like? 

I mean, we can't tell if you do it. You can actually do it. 

Yeah, he he probably don't. 

Do it by API. Yeah, it would just be, yeah, we so we. 

It's it's more dynamic about outside it's taking. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it would be, yeah. 

So we can do quite a lot like we have we have. Plans that will deliver in London. And then with me by the temporary. 

Michael, he's currently there now. 

Road not like Rd. closed, but they called like. Red rooms so they can. They can only they can't jump through it, so it's times a day or they can't stop with. Certain types of day. They can travel through it so. You can do cover things with the maps so that it. Around it or you can jump through it. You've got stop up and we can use things like time Windows to be. Able to look for that. The only way you can do it is. To dynamically and it would be really happy, yeah. 

Working on it. 

Yeah, so my research is mainly on. 

Alright, fantastic. Really, really. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

So you you've come, you've come across us before? 

On the website. 

It's really cool. 

Vehicles and yeah, this is what's nice about six or seven years ago. 

It's essentially we're doing.
