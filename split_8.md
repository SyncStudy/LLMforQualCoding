And it doesn't have to say spiders, and that could be something that says. That address is changed. Now we need to take that to the. Locker. Yeah, very. 

Ohh I see. 

And and and that we could also say. Something else I imagine. 

You're using it for. 

Load the van. 

It could be that you say mounting green. So I'll I'll scan the ones I undertake. Now I can get my ID, so imagine I've picked them up. I'm now going to take you to the customer. You're delivering a case of high quality wine customer. We need to make sure. They're old enough. Because of the legislation and the locations need to make sure that this person we look at that it's it scans that for us that scans varies by age so. 

Right. I see. I see. 

I could do that with. I'll do it with my own, my own. The retailers banking system for some reason. See it is a. 

Reduction of error. 

Yeah, and it has. You need it to be high speed as well. So so for myself, like yourself? It's it should be. Should be built into into smartphone. So what what we have now is instead of having delivery driver I'm a the dedicated barcode reading device. Is our format say to them on your phone, we will tell you on your phone this is you need to scale up very quickly. So if you have. The big events that make you have something like. About is the first situation. Or maybe it's another event where? We do have situations. Where you have one of our great. Then you burn. Just tell people to come along to the to our work for us. Lot of work with me so. You need to have the vehicle, valid driver side and then you don't. 

To give them anything all you give. 

Them is you passes. That's give them a service as yeah. There are certain discounts in terms of sort of widening scandal. As well, Steve. 

All the tracking. 

And like compliance with like specific live verification. 

The technology experience for consumers outside. 

All that we can reduce the uncertainty in the midst of hatching under this. 

Open up the phone and do exactly. 

So by the app there's scanning functionality within the app. 

I would add that. 

For us, we provide the software development kit. Inside your own app. OK enables you to do this. So so it's it's there, it's. Something you can plug into your app and then. Yes, you've customized it specific to your requirement. Code and examples, all that kind of stuff, so you can do it, but it means that you can do a HR and implemented solution. And I think it's very powerful when things need to scale up. They added 250,000 people to their workforce in just six weeks. So you will never be able to go buy 2. 150,000. 2000 block shots in that fashion and and train everyone. Now. If you say to. Them you must download this phone. 

We'll give you his name. 

Or you have your own phone downloaded that. With all the training. And then all of. This stuff is in the app so. 

Yes, like so. 

Yeah, yeah, that's the idea. 

Yeah, sure, sure. 

So all that, we're never going to develop. 

Out of your own scan.
