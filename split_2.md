Like the outcome, on average we save about 26% for miles. 

There, it's going really well. 

Something really just one up and they don't just wanna do miles of money. 

And fuel is obviously, yeah, improved asset utilization because if you're doing 100 vehicles and you're now doing 28% or 20% fewer miles, well then you don't need as many vehicles and the vehicles you are using, you've got higher utilization. 

They're trying to do it, you know. 

Went up in the area by yeah.

Well, where we checked change the back end first. 

And then they change. 

Yeah, that's what we're trying to do. I mean, let's just punish the white. Well, now what? It's the end. It's it's totally possible. He did this for touching system challenging. 

And so I think.
