So we that's actually a really, really, really focused question. I I don't actually have an answer for you. What we focus on is providing our careers. To give them a lot for our delivery. If the warning gets cancelled, if the customers on the way on the careers in the way the carrier just goes back to the store and all of its cancel. 

I I actually and so. How about like the road Rd. I remember we will run the algorithm. 

Yeah, we have our GPS system, our own GPS system. We'll find a way. It just removes the destination, correct? It will just update automatically. The road closure sorry is going to be. 

An extra sector, it's. 

See something I do? 

What's like you mentioned about like in the franchising or like? 

Is anything any retailers? It's up to. 

The retailer I actually I see so. The business model. Is essentially on. 

OK. 

She will get. 

Needed to the retailer through the order and so essentially we have implemented this automatically rebooting algorithm. 

You're that's way too. Technical for me, I actually don't know. 

Yeah. Yeah, no. 

No at night. I believe it, I believe it. Like we have this complete plan or this absolutely. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

You can take this one just. Basically searching more information. 

Yeah. So really appreciate it. 

And if you want to get and talk. To the emails on the back, OK. 

OK. So I have a card or. 

You can you can get in touch. On the e-mail? That's. 

OK. OK. OK. 

That's my e-mail that's directly. 

Thanks so much. 

What are the odds? 

Did you say did you say? And we should get the transaction. 

Yeah, I mean. 

I think most of the online news trending things. So those things. 

I mean clearly you. 

After that, in the back office, you know lots. 

Of different marriages. 

Right. But in fact, if we. 

Should they patch? They scan. 

Really digitally well, what is this? 

How are you? 

I'm a PhD student. That's the one thing like. One question about like last month, I would have seen a large amount of this. 

OK, go ahead. 

We're actually, we're already working. 

With the software. Just work with the Ukraine sympathy solution. OK. But yeah, so we we only have they they help with to do some development, some QA and yeah, yeah, yeah. 

So if there is a problem, we're able to capture that and and proactively reach out to the customer. 

Yes, we're going well, we've worked with five years. Now so yeah. 

So they get information. 

No worries. Have a. Nice day. You too. 

And and and and. And that helps rather than have the the customer. 

Call it and so. 

So like a part on that was like the. We'll be back. 

About what we're doing is is providing, yeah, we've we've provided. 

Just providing you with feedback. 

That's what the platform is is it is a process is the information. And and sends it to the right of the right place. 

I say I see.
