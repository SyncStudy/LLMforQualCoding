Thank you everybody. You have tears as doesn't match the border. 

Pressure. So you see here that now. 

We'll be able to. 

Democratise this. Better not be captured by commercial. Intuitive but. 

Yeah, yeah, I think I'm. Marketing, I think. 

OK. 

It's probably less acceptable to effectively capture no guarantee, but I think at least the mechanisms. 

I was just wondering about the certain things that. You could collect. Is it? Is it? Limited in somewhat. If you're spending a lot of samples, or if you're studying gene expression levels. 

About reading as the products are separated so we can come from these devices. Obviously some devices. Have restricted but they. Will have somebody to get around that you can visit like in the. Obviously there's some consumer base has around. This is 1 everyday. Sort of found with. Some groups before. Separate diabetes. We're actually in discussion with great disease week last weekend. And they're coming first in the process of. 

Trying to development. 

Partnership with UK wildlife has a lot of information to research. Yeah, so basically. The more the data, that's more captive validations in in their environment. But everytime like for example. Conscious, with wide bands, etcetera. Both the and not Vegas constraints. 

Want someone to contribute to the fire? 

So that's one thing. Yeah. I mean, so why make a lot of information that's there and I? 

Think if you know that. 

Well, I mean we need to, I mean there. Might be probably. 

Will be something about that I think, because we're working late initiatives basically and he wants to do this year I think. Possible, but I think over time we don't really want to rely on these entities and the access. 

That's right. 

So it sounds like you're trying. 

To cover a lot of bases with this, a lot of different features of the product. Which elements is which? 

Great question. See. 

I don't mention them on the slides and research platform and. All the things that we discussed. 

Interesting for the year. 

So at the moment, because the. Actually launched and that government work. Promoting building the. 

Thank you. I was putting it fine organised.

Because for a few weeks. 

To spare because his aim was pulled out and he's kind of replacement speakers are not. Can you speak with a few minutes to spare? But, but it's going well, he says he's going to dial it. So I've just been so as he. Was from the. Project, which is from the open source software. To find somebody like that and his colleague is also from the he's. Excuse me, Git Point project so. It's the same project. Just people don't get to darling after the. To ask your question real quick. 

From the. 

Beneficiary interests and where your sets the goals because you have business and you have the same. It's just another. 

Yeah, I mean that's that's an important question. 

I mean that that way with the, with the beaches, I mean this is interest is to lock people in, to buy constantly stuff. But the fishery interest is to take a solution which is cost effective or safety, so that's affordable and once for all or mostly once for all and that's. Basically all this problem to. See with the NHS. All follows the health system. 

I wonder if. 

The difference between finances and capitalising on. 

Pardon. Yeah. 

Let me try and reconnect, all right. 

I guess. Ten element 5th. You just bring people here. Yeah, there's lots of research into privacy of health data, and a lot of that research says that. People are less concerned about the the privacy of the data and they are about the commercial use of data. They're they're they're much more concerned that their data is going to be. Used for purposes that they that is making someone else money. So just cheque. You should be able to hear us. So no idea. 

Why Google Google? 

Meet just decided to limit this. You can use it for. Now and then. It cuts you off and zoom I. Understand. And they they they were actually making money. Uses Google. You can't use it. Can you hear us? Are you muted? Hello I can see now can you. 

Hello I still can't hear you. 

One moment. Let me see. 

Audio settings. 

Yeah. So if we look here, we could, that's a good point that speaking there. So internal microphone. Can somebody are you on telegram? So yeah, your telephone was. If if you just tell me, well, we we can see it and just. 

You've seen the business, but I mean you could and. 

We have this. 

Yeah, good point. Good point challenge to be. 

So it looks like we. 

Have one one way communication happening. You can you can see. 

Me and hear. 

Me, I cannot hear you. Which is really important because I'd love to be. It looks like, I guess what we're. Trying to do is. Communicate via chat. Or maybe we could try a different platform if I send. To Google meet Link, would that be OK? 

Thank you. 

Sorry about that would be so great. 

You know. 

Our technology. 

Can you hear me? Hello. 

Can you hear us? 

Hey, I still can't hear you, Dan. I guess if technology won't cooperate, maybe we just keep rolling type of thing that have told. 

Produces smart. 

Let me know. 

If you want me to just go ahead and. Start and I can. And it's not. 

We're about to get terrible. 

Hi I can hear you. Yeah, and I can. See this. This is great. 

OK. 

Alright. Awesome. Really. What are what? Are the most ghetto setups we've. Ever had to do anything? And. Because at least it's. Working. Yeah. Great to see you. My name is Umar. I'm from Bitcoin and it's awesome to see. Wow. Nice crowd over there. Hey guys. I thought it was maybe just me and rose. Today. So I'm I'm feeling kind. Of last minute, Azine was supposed to be. Able to make it today, but unfortunately he's. Not feeling well. So you got you got. Me and I'm OK, I am. Really glad to be able to. Join you all today and. 

At this. 

Place called Zuzu right now in Montenegro. It's I think one of the most magical places ever. It's like a little crypto pop up city and there's a. Gathering of a. Bunch of people from. Etherium space-time all here and I've just been. Getting the soap in. Really stimulating intellectual contributions for like. The last two months. I think about like two more weeks here. But anyway, what? I'd like to tell you. A little bit about today is like Bitcoin. That's where I work for Zen works, and we're a. Organisation in web 3. That is trying to fund public goods. We originally started in 2017 trying to find more funding for open source software. So far, we've funded over $50 million in this. Space and the types of things. We fund are things that normally don't have a. Profit. I don't normally have a method of. And these are really important things to fund, because they're when everything else gets built on, I think my favourite example of an open source software and most people just Linux. Linux is something everyone contributes. To that now. Runs most of the cloud. Computing services everyone uses, whether it's AWS through the. Cloud computing, we all. And we're so lucky that back in the day. Linux was created that was. Created in an open source way, but because it's open source, it's actually. You know, it's really hard to. Make money off of unless. You do what? Amazon and Google does. And they use this software and they provide a service, but that money doesn't end up flowing back to the people who actually created it. So we try and do is provide ways. To fund people who? Are really creating that open source software and so for us in the web 3 space. A lot of. The open source software that runs crypto. Does it get funded well? There are projects that you have to for example be able to connect your wallet to a product and be able to interact with these protocols on the Internet, and luckily they have created these open source. Libraries that now anyone can just go and. They can connect. Their wallet and everybody uses the same open source library that has just become the standard. And because we have those standards and we all share them, it's much easier for us to rely on. As a service. So we've been able to fund over $50 million. 

Of public goods. 

And we've been able to do this because of a. Really large community effort. At this point we use something called quadratic. Funding. It's a method that italic uberin. Came up with in. 2018 Vitalic also is the inventor of etherium. In this space is really. A champion for decentralisation or. Communities making decisions together, rather than one central person making all the decisions. Which is kind of. Shocking, considering he could easily with how much power he has with the fact that he's been cured. Ethereum really make all the calls. But he actively says. I don't want to do that. I want the. Community to be making. Decisions. And he came up with this. Called quadratic funding while working with. Glenn, well, so we hit today and they released. This paper in 2018. And what it is is essentially a democratic mechanism for allowing a community to make a decision together, and it's called quadratic funding because essentially what happens is you gather a large. Sum of money and then. You determine how to distribute that money based on the quadratic factor of the. Votes that people submit. And so whenever. Someone votes for something you take the. Square root of their vote. And you assign a matching amount. To that vote. That's proportional to the square. So the quadratic funding mechanism basically just take a step back has two steps, one is a matching pool is raised, and this is largely comes from big donors for us in the etherium ecosystem who want to see a theory. Of continue to succeed. And it's that they might be a. Theory of foundation point based. Polygon A60Z that they really want. To see the interior because. And they'll help us raise this large mass. And then we run a crowdfunding campaign. So public goods projects in the space we're able. To say we need funding, we need to. Raise some money. Who out there wants to help us? And they'll submit these projects, they'll tell us what they're. Working on and. Then the community gets to come in and crowd fund those projects and each one of those crowdfunding contributions gets multiplied based on the quadratic funding formula. This method ends up being really democratic because large donors to that crowdfunding campaign aren't able to have as much of an influence as they would otherwise. A typical matching campaign, because the fact that their vote gets. You take the square root of. The factor of their vote. So that it gets only proportionally matched to that and. The root and it is it being much smaller. And so in that way, that's it being. More Democratic and some of the practical. And luckily this is a system that we see work really well for allowing what the Community. We wanted to get in London. And what we've seen is that over the past four years it's been. Something that really resonates. The ego. In 2019, when we started running Bitcoin brands, we only were able to raise about $1,000,000. And then what we've seen over the last four? Years is just. People love this listening. They love seeing that when. They donate $1.00 to a project. It can turn into $100 because of this quadratic lending metric factor, and so we've gone from being able to distribute less to the. Millions of public goods. To over 20 million. To and over 50 million overall. Last year we were really happy to run. As part of. What is this this growing? Movement of design the first ever game point grants Eastside round. 

It was. 

Really amazing to see the energy come in behind this community driven effort. But these around was something that we wanted to run and. We sort of asked our community if we should. Run this and. There was so much phenomenal support for it. Everyone was so excited about these times and it ended up being one of our biggest rounds that raised over $500,000 from Natalie, Peter and himself on the name file point Springer Nature. And many other organisations. And those $500,000 that were this matching pool, the crowd is able to determine how they want that to go to the projects they care the most about. And was really cool to see. Was that some really phenomenal projects that were just built in open source technology for science came out of the woodwork and said, you know, we haven't been public, but we're working on this thing and we need community support because our project is really something that is a public. Good. And is it? Going to be something. That makes money, but obviously it needs. Money to take off everyone. And some of those. Projects have gone on. To be like. I've I've gone on to just get bigger and bigger and ship products. There's a few different ones that I really like. And that the community has thrown their support behind. That I'll just kind of shout out really quickly and then maybe go. Into some questions. But what I. Love about these guys. Is that it's this movement that's really leveraging. Web three tools. Technology to. Improve some of the structures and incentives of science to make it easier to get funding to make it easier to participate in open science movements and make these online networks of collaboration that have organically important even more tangible for verifying results. 

One of the. 

Things that I like. The most is just when people open source. The ability to do science and share. That with. Other people. There's this great. Project out there right now at. This point that just got funded in our most recent round of just DNA sequence. And it's basically open sourcing the. Ability to analyse. Your own team. They have 23 open source repos that let you keep your genetic information private from large corporations like 23andMe, but still get all of the same insights. You can annotate your own genome. You can analyse using data for cancer risks, drug interacts with cardiac disease. And get a comprehensive, transparent open source report and. If you really. Like it, you can also contribute to making it even better. So this is just like one of those like. Great examples of a. Community different driven project. That's open source. And is something you can contribute to and grow. As well as being something that. And keep your information 5. Another project that's really. Cool is trying to enable self sovereign scientific IP or decentralised society registry. It's called OPS, diversity and what it's doing is creating a system that doesn't have traditional gatekeepers, but instead still measures your your impact through a decentralised. For consensus and it lets. You connect to your organ ID to. A crypto wallet so that you can put your. Contributions on chain and fractionalize them and let your impact be attested to in a way that's public permanent. And allows value to be transferred seamlessly. So that if. There are any financial gains in your research. They can trickle down where they should based on who created the impact of that research. And then one more project that's really interesting. Doing decentralised clinical trial testing for Alzheimer's. A lot of the interventions we see people trying to do right now for Alzheimer's or drug based and. What's really cool about? Getting the community. To weigh in. On what we should fund. Is that they'll fund things that maybe wouldn't get funded otherwise. And there's this really. Cool therapy right now being run by Doctor and visit that is conducting a novel research method to how can we for Alzheimer's and things like light and sound people are normally exposed to ultraviolet round light for red light. But there's some really promising data that shows being. 

Exposed to these things. 

Can trigger certain pathways in the brain that allow. That allows greater memory recall, and they've already obtained a patent for hardware software headset that has demonstrated really tangible effects. And just by its sound therapy, and by doing that, they've been able to circumvent some of the slow and costly routes for using and testing this. Certain equipment that normally occurs when you go to the FDA approved clinical trial study and the gear that they've created is something that can be really readily available to the pub. To have the ability. To provide first in time decentralised trial and this is just really exciting to see something. Like this? Happening that you. Wouldn't normally see through traditional funding happenings. And and I think that's what's really exciting about these diet is it is unlocking the ability for anyone to contribute to science and for it to all happen together online. And that's it for me. 

With the. 

Thank you so much. 

That was brilliant. He is. OK, fantastic. I'm going to reboot my computer and bring you back into the power session. Hopefully if I reboot my computer, we'll fix the sound and the power will be back from jitsi. So I'll speak to you again in a few minutes. 

Thank you very much. 

Right now. 

So all I can think. To do is reboot my computer because somewhere panel with that feedback panel. And so, Joel, thank you very much for coming to to be the moderator. I'm going to do, I'm going to just do a quick. Restart and hopefully hopefully fix this. All your issue and we've been. Panel there anything you wanted to say prior to the panel you can introduce yourself? 

Enjoy and introduce myself. Hi John. My name is John Fletcher, I'm CEO of. A company called Cambridge. 

Cryptographic and. 

You're weird. Involved in the D size. Based for actually I started thinking about it about 10. 

Years ago, when I gave. 

A book called Decentralising Science. With crypto economics in the house before in Cambridge about 2014. Early on and it seems to. 

Interested in? 

Maybe interested in at the moment is. Putting it into context. The the the link, decentralised science and and and open source and many of you. Know that the sort of. 

Phenomenal story of open source accessories being. 

One of the things I I believe it's some underappreciated about open source is that open source operates on a commercial basis. Everybody likes to hear some good moving story. Not not saying. You know, moving stories and people getting together and. Their, you know, all kind. Of helping one another is a bad thing. The thing about the source of making unique is that although it is a good thing, it's also a commercially. And and and I believe every economists around. Wrong and wrong person. Example of a of a of a privately produced public good. They produced that scale that people didn't even believe this was possible before. Previously, public goods come from either you know government, which is, which is the money comes from general taxation or philanthropic activities. It's it's it's normal. That normally comes from anarchic people. There, sort of, you know, get together and and and have a sort of commercial, some private. This is really something interesting. 

For you imagine if like. 

Outputs from fundamentals of academic science. And public goods. But of course they're not, you know, producing decentralised manner. They depend on the centralised funding sources. And if they weren't? You know, funded by, you know, society much poorer. For it, of course, but you have. Many issues which are related to the fact that. You know, it's funny. You have committed people and let them sit down and say we're gonna make the funding to that, like in the Soviet Union and this to sit down and say. What you think that the? Price is gonna be this week. It's a very suboptimal way if you could. Do it by. The market it it would be a lot better. Nobody has discovered. A way of. Doing it here, so it's also the step towards that open source operational market basis. Because it is commercial. It's funny and go to some people in business and sometimes they. Say, hey, we've open sourced our software or. Open source everything. Sometimes you ask them do you open source? And they say no, because it simply doesn't. The sense for us, you know, our value capture the thing that we have of our asset is our. Source code or? You know, maybe it's location and then I keep your propietary and and it is a bit strange, sort of almost like. Well, you know, these guys open source. They're good guys. These guys don't. Open source? Maybe they're not quite. Such good stuff. But when the people who? Don't open source. Don't. Open source. It doesn't make you. Sense that people who. Do open source open source because it. Does make economic sense? Their code bases might have different structures. They're doing different types of projects. It's simply a case by case basis. It's not a sort of, you know, good versus. Evil story. You know, it's like. So it's got. A Long story short of our approach or the innovation there, and it may causes it to make economic sense to open source more things than before. It changes the equilibrium so that fewer people will say no doesn't make sense. Plus global sourcing our business because you know that's where our manufacturing and you'll pay for the money. Moved pensioner from one side to the. Other so again, you know public goods and also a wonderful thing if they're not. If they don't make economic sense and that. 

Sort of thing. 

Hi, guys. Can you hear us? 

Hey, Dana, I can hear you. 

Can you hear us? 

We can't hear you if you can hear us. So John, because the their. Microphone is coming from the laptop. Can you try and can you speak for fear so they can hear? 

You OK? So am I the only person? Yeah. Ohh.

I'd like to Mike, Philip and Andrew come down, please, if you don't mind doing so, we can use the microphone so. Hopefully you can hear the microphone. 

Thank you. 

I can hear you good. 

Thanks. Great. 

With her microphone. 

If she, or maybe she's. 

OK. Can you hear me? 

This is turned up to the next one I. Guess people can hear that, right? So this should help the the remote consistency here and OK. 

Which kind of? 

You guys. 

OK so. 

I think I already did my introduction, yeah.

So you know. OK, I'm. I'm politically speaking. In a moment on in peace and foundation. And we've done your, we've done your introduction. And so I guess the questions you are and then over to you to chair the panel, wait to see if we can, George, she's always here. 

Ohh could take. 

OK, so so e-mail has we people want? To ask him questions. Actually I got. 

Thank you. 

A question if you can hear me. 

Can you hear me? Yeah. 

I can hear you. It's a little it's. Real hard but. I think I can make it most OK. There's just, like echo. Yeah, it's all good. Looks like we can hear. Rishma or someone with with her. 

Yeah, looks like we've. Got an additional person? I'm. 

Not sure. OK, hope they're. 

Quite young anyway. I'll just go ahead and ask my question regarding Bitcoin. One thing I don't quite understand is that you're saying that the big donors will have less impact. Why can't they just split up their donations? To lots of little. 

Ones and and. 

And and pretend that they're many donors, given those. Web 3 surely that. Would be quite easy to do. 

Sorry, can you repeat that? Why? Would public goods. 

Just like. 

Yeah, and in. A sense they. Just couldn't get more match funding so they. Split up their large donation into a smaller donation. 

Yes, this is definitely a big problem we face. It's. That if you have $10 and. You know that each. $1.00 You give will get five more than. Giving a donation $10, why would you not split those $10 into 10 donations of $1.00 across multiple accounts? 

Is that the question? 

That's great. That's my question. 

Yeah, cool. Yeah, that's a huge problem we face. And it's a big problem that a lot of web three faces when. Trying to do. Things like airdrops or making sure that you can give out Ubi to individual people and not. To someone with multiple. Accounts what we built is we built a product called. My passport, which is a way to identify. Unique individual what it does is it. Determines for each person, a cost of forgery. So of course you can. Make multiple accounts. And what we try and do is measure how expensive is it for you to make those? Multiple account and can we make? It sufficiently expensive to deter packets from the system. So what Gateway password does is it will aggregate your identity from across the Internet in. Many different ways. So when you sign into this passport, you'll be asked to. Connect your Twitter your. Google account, you know, we'll. Cheque your on chain history to see. What kind of transactions you you've engaged in? Do you own things like O apps? Do you have an ENS name? In other words, have you done all the things that we would expect? A person to. Do and if you have, it's more likely that you are. A real person that that. Cost forgery is. Higher and when if you've reached a sufficiently high bar, then you get matching funding. And if you don't? Reach that far. Your funds are not. Mapped, but they are still donated. Which of course benefits the projects power. 

Right. 

And you can cheque it. 

Out at passport.com. 

Thank you. Thank you. That's that's interesting. Thank you. Maybe I should. He's the only one. Who hasn't been? 

Sorry, are you there? Can you hear us? 

Yes, I can. Can you hear me? Hi. 

Great to see you for joining. Would you like to introduce? Yourself briefly. Thank you. 

Sure, I'm resting by just recently left. Springer Nature works as the strategy and operations CEO and I have a great interest in decentralised science and AI. Sounds good. 

Hey Richmond, for the period. So I'm actually really sad to hear that you. Yeah. Hi, everybody. So I'm calling. I'm economist at the Free University in Amsterdam and started. Design labs and the Desai Foundation two years ago, and I think in a little bit, I'm going to tell you that some of the things that we that we're building and how we can. 

Right. 

OK, so do you have a? Preferred structure with this or do. I just do. 

Whatever I want. 

It's been going so well, you know. 

Yeah. OK. I'll just do everyone. Tell me to stop if we're going too crazy. I I I I have a sort of just a couple of, you know, high level points about decentralised. Science and since. We have a few experts, maybe. They can just sort. Of chip in. And you know, I might play a player, sort of devil's advocate, and these guys can can tell me sort of, you know, where I'm going wrong or if I'm going wrong. That might be an interesting. Dynamic. So one thing that concerns me about decentralised. Science and and actually many many. Web three projects in general is that there's. It's hard to tell whether the token. And often there's a token involved is an investment, or is it a charitable donation? Or often, I think in fact it's more like a lottery ticket. So if you buy a lottery ticket, what you are in fact doing is making a charitable donation, but you can obviously you know, there's a chance that you win a lot of money, you'll sort of win big. So everybody knows if you buy it, you know crypto coin, it could move for example. But the often the the expected value is negative and This is why you know no asset, that same asset manager. Would ever sort of make an allocation to lottery tickets. You know the the allocation to lottery is 0 because it's not. It's a terrible invest. And so it it's kind of unclear sometimes if they don't, many of these projects, there's not a clear way to capture value and so people are really saying far as I can tell, is buy a a ticket, a buy a buy a token because it's for a good cause. We're we're we're aiming to do a good thing. The token might go up in value as everybody knows. I mean, people might say, oh, there's no expectation of profit. 

Of course. 

You know that some, some people. Hope hope that it will. Go up. So maybe it's an investment, but if there's no value capture, it can't be an investment. So it has to. Just be a lottery ticket, so I'd be. Interested in these kind of. You know, experts views on this, I mean, and even, you know the most successful protocols somehow. It's unclear what the value capture is. I mean, a Bitcoin of course, would be spectacularly by far and away the most successful. It's it's only way of generating revenue, capturing value as fees. Bitcoins fees don't cover the cost of running the network even probably one millionth you know probably like 100,000 costs. It's absolutely absurd. No, no protocol has gone even close to generating as much revenue as it, you know, requires to run. And as they scale, for example. The theory fees are high, but obviously as they as they scale they they will go down as any good economist knows, if you if you have 10 times the amount of lobsters in the sea, it doesn't make all the fishermen rich. Actually what happens is the price of. Lobster goes down. Disproportionately, and and everybody gets a lot poorer, so. Yeah, maybe I'll be happy. Is it is it? Is it?

So I cannot speak to that generally. And so the only thing that I can tell you is that when when we started thinking about design, we obviously saw that there is a lot of potentials for for token use in in science. But at the same time, we decided to be very, very cautious about this. There is obviously a lot of talkers out there that have very questionable value, as you just indicated. We also think that a large part of the scientific community is just not ready for that yet. And in fact, if you introduce a token that is that is fungible and tradable, that it needs to provide an absolutely clear value. 

To its users. 

So we have some ideas about this, but this is going to. Be far down. The line and for being consciously very, very careful about this. So that's what I can say about that. 

Yes, the question was. 

Is it? Is it? 

Yeah. What is the nature of? The tone and is it invested? Is it lottery ticket? Is it philanthropic donation? Buying one? Or is it combination of all 3A? Form of entertainment. I'm not sure how. 

It doesn't it it it does depend on the itself, but I think at the very least it can be all of those things and I think that's kind of the advantage of our traditional kind of crowdfunding mechanisms. Versus Destiny type recommend, I think if you have economic incentives alongside the philanthropic side of things, you'll actually raise more money. 

Well, I think. 

The audience not really be that it's it's kind of causing economic capture and value for the people who actually, but they need to be abandoned. This is actually beneficial to the cause of in the 1st place, whilst there's an economic benefit potentially. You want to ultimately create innovation of that piece of life, so it's really difficult to do so. The right manner, but I think. We like like the the suggestion suggested, are thinking very carefully about how that would work because we've seen so many examples of when. Open systems go wrong. And we're very conscious of that and. The patient points that. We work with are also quite a bit of actually do this and that there's a solution there. Yeah. So we want to communicate that first and everything like that. 

Any either of you guys want to chip in? Did you hear the question? 

I can add. 

To this from. 

The Bitcoin perspective a little bit, we launched it. In about two years ago. Bitcoin was in. This position of being a centralised company with the CEO and the CEO made the decisions, made the calls. So one of the things you wanted to figure. Out was what does it look like to be decentralised? What does it look like to allow? A group of people to be making decisions together and for us, a token ended up being one of the ways in which you can create this way to. How do you think this? Because in our DAO decentralised autonomous organisation, how much of the token you own represents your voting power? How much of A say you have in the government and what the collective group is deciding? And so really, that's what. Our token does. It's a governance token, it's. A decision making token it's not. A lottery ticket. I wouldn't expect to make a tonne of money off of this. It's really only a signal of how much do you care about the decisions that this organisation makes. And how much? Of a say do you want to have? And for us, that's what it represents. 

Just just do come back on that. Thanks for that answer, Robert. So you, you, you you mentioned just a minute ago that you have a sort of reasonably reliable method of identifying sort of an individual person. So did you ever consider that? And maybe you could. Just have a vote A1. Person one vote. Given that you have that ability and what do you think is the downside of having a one person one vote decision as opposed to being people being able to buy as many votes as they as they like? 

It is a. 

Little bit hard. To hear I think the. Question was what is the trade off between doing one person? 

Yeah, exactly. 

Just shout. 

This is a super complicated question. You know there's an entire field of mechanism design and. 

How do you create these decisions? 

And I know my opinion is going. To be very short. Of like investigating on this is going to be, especially because I myself not affect as a designer or the. Personal designer, but all I'll. 

Say is. 

I think in a lot. Of cases, the extremes on any decision end up. Being wrong and that. There's a middle ground that it's being created. And I I think. This is where this is where that's true. 

Question I'm sorry, yes. 

Token design specifically. Like actually experiencing to this world so. I I don't have much bad, that's my recommendation. In terms of volume to turn the. Volume 90 bit down because it will help us on this phone. This is a lot of echo. 

Yeah, sorry because we're testing through the system. The the echoes inevitable, I think. 

Let me yeah. It is inevitable. Well, try. 

Yeah, just the discussion just to me it sounds. Like you have the. Cryptocurrency vacuum. But it's not a vacuum. It's an. Embedded in the real economy. So if we really only change savages, so the whole game is a bit for change then. So the question is, why would you? Go to a cryptocurrency when the economy changes you, you. Could do something else as well, I mean. This is again a. Visible through patient, but still I think the the the the sterile looking at in a sterile way that that it is embedded how how do you take into account that the economy is in the falling dollar dollar might come up so dollars? Thought twice week. During during the stage mechanism, the whole stripper economy. So what? And this maybe you have an idea. 

Yeah, it. 

Might actually have the. 

22 part answer to that. Parliament it's it's it's expected that will be generating money, right? But I. I don't like to actually benefit of saying that it is. Part of the economy as we. Understand it, because if you're saying that, then we would seem that we are physically tied to conventional finance like. So I mean, if you were to do that, I guess I would assume that whatever. We're doing in design. Would directly impact other sectors and. Their traditional finance, like maybe Big Pharma. Big data any. Of that, but I tend to think is this. 

But it it's it's true, isn't it? The opposite is true. Not you impact the other, but obviously impact you. 

Yet officers just exactly the opposite. Is true because you're really doing this. That you're taking? Fiat, whether it's on a gold standard or not. Now, generally you don't see. That is, and then we're if we're capable of being wealthy enough in that world, we can then sort of convert some of that into a crypto asset then. We can invest in decentralised networks. So if you would go from. The D size side. If indeed you're going to democratise people's the communities choices, saying like, OK, maybe we've got a laboratory scientist whom we can Commission, so we say, OK, we'll get a bunch of votes and then the community wants these votes. This assume that we can verify that this is one person and not one donation split upon like maybe a. 

Million different accounts. 

Assuming that problem is solved, then whatever the result is of that democratic process, maybe the Commission laboratory can then work on what they want. But you cannot then immediately expect that whatever they produce is directly convertible to the economy as we know it. That is definitely the case, because usually the easiest thing about travelling is that you're filling in vacuums of opportunity. The vacuums exist, you see it, you capitalise on it with skills and assets that you could invest in. Then you build a product that people are going to buy because that vacuum is. Fundamentally, the result of demand. Right. But in D side, most of what people are doing in D side is that we don't even really know if there is a vacuum, what ends up being, what ends up. Happening is we see what people want to. And that's a vacuum in their perceived interests, as opposed to a vacuum in the market, right, the commercial. 

Side of things. 

So I don't think there really is a way that we can confirm that, you know, like you can actually consolidate the creation of real value into the economy via design. Unless you can say at the very start that, hey, you guys want to vote on this idea the moment we complete this research? We're then going to capitalise it on your behalf and then when that product or service comes out, they get remunerated in like in proportion to their vote. And even that's not exactly reciprocal, because the government structure is going to vary, it's going to be like who voted. For it and who voted? Against it. So it really is. Sort of up in the air, I would say. 

Then you have the value discussed discussion. I mean, sorry to say just answer that because I mean you you have a distribution mechanism. But what's the value of that and what can you do with that? 

I mean. You need if you allocate funds, you know the fund must be. You must be able to operate this funds or to use these funds. It's just, it's just. 

Funny tokens. They use this so because. 

It's it's. It's a bit. Provocative. But I just want to see. 

How you think about that that way so? 

That's why I think there should be like an enclosed sphere, so I think. That's why it's gave the example of the Commission lab. So what I would say is like for example, when we use a Macy's dollar, we convert it to a gift card. But those dollars now only usable at Macy's at that. Department store in that same way. I mean there's various ideas that blocking has thought about it. Like let's say I invest in someones token. Well if I want to use that token, it's not just buying me governance privileges. I can actually actually put. It to a real. Utility. The problem is most of these blocking companies don't have real utility yet. They're building infrastructure for foreseeable utilities that can translate to the wider economy. So maybe I can say that here's an example. The the fastest way to ensure that what you were investing via crypto asset has immediate value that we can tie to the wider economy is by investing in something that has intrinsic value. Inherently. Well, let's say that maybe my medical data has value. First what I do is identify who in traditional finance would find my medical data. They're useful. OK, there are people out there. We identify the empires and we see what other? Maybe AI has a way to actually capitalise on new medical advances by saying, oh, I can take a photo of your face and then determine your ageing spectrum or whatever that might be. Well, then someone might figure out a way to turn that into an NFT, and that's already a crypto asset that we can invest in. So you. Sort of eliminate that problem from the bottom up, but that's just another method that people can try to get to, but that's because they've already found an application before they already started building the blockchain info, so it really does depend on the company. If there are people who are trying to decide research. That is the biggest. It's hard to figure that out. 

We do research exactly that, and the other argument. Is the same. You have the commodity backed currency, I mean the. 

Yeah. Yeah, it's a really it's a fundamental topic, right? 

OK. 

But it's just. A slight. Actually, what I already said, but it's interesting, the academic science is a very interesting field of economics initially. And the reason why government tends to fund academic science is because commercial sector won't fund it and they won't fund it for. A very good. Reason it's because. They come up, you know, academic science is coming up with new new sort of methods. And you know, really kind of understanding of the of of, of the natural world and it's not always obvious whether these. To have any application and if. They do. How? How long it will be before they have an application it it's difficult to secure property rights when you when you don't even have the application in mind. You're really just trying to get a better understanding of nature. The thing is about that, because they know that when we do have a better understanding of nature, at least you tend to get a sort of spill over value into technology companies whose people find applications. Down the track and the money doesn't, unfortunately accrue back to the academic scientists typically who came up with the discoveries because because they don't have property rights of these. And for the reasons I just mentioned, but the government uniquely can tax the domestic technology. Industry so it can. Machine value capture from the best in academic science. Nobody else can. And so that maybe the the the idea that that now we've invented blockchain, blockchain can well, maybe it can, but you have to explain the mechanism for that. That would be kind of magical. There is one other way that academic science. Is funded, which is through charitable for them to drop it. So to me, I sort of suspect and and one thing that concerns me is that there's a token for something like centralised science and people assume it to be an investment, but because there's no valley country is not and. It's actually a charitable donation. And donating charity money to charity for Science is is is is absolutely fantastic, but you have to. Know that's what you're doing. Yeah, and and I and what I what I'm concerned about is the people, you know, mistaken a film, a a donation. Because there isn't any value caption. There are some things you get patterns on, but traditionally you get patterns on it. You can capture the value. That's commercial science. It's not academic science that so it's already done in industry because they. Already have value capture. So it seems a bit. Yeah, it's confusing to me. And no, it's really explained the value capture mechanism for for the academic science in science. Yeah, maybe. 

So I guess there is not one protocols out there already that. That I'm using. Virtual based incentive mechanism was basically to to find science or thinking. Molecule beta Tau, right? So they have this idea of PFTS. That seem to be working to some. Extent and actually I have. A question for you in in planning protocols. So how are you guys thinking about? Where's the funding going? To come from the that you. Decide on all of the incentives to investors. To put money into. 

You know. Yeah. So, yeah, we'll see. Umm. Capital programme resident to build obviously a token sale, but I think for all the reasons I've revisited how we used to be very careful about the design of that. 

Right. 

And so yeah, that's that's the obvious question. And the Russians, the other regions around the when that will be returned there. 

OK. Right. 

Yeah. So. The that the ecosystem that we're developing, we obviously want to make them accessible. To the border. Population. So I think like how molecule is. Looking to the IP Lt to the the research that they conduct will probably do a very similar thing for that, but also because we have, we're because the the the ecosystem building will have patients and will be sharing their data. There'll be a lot of people interested in. If he's interested in looking at that data so there is, there will be some kind of. Fees that would. We would love to be, yeah. And use that as. We will to people who actually. Use as well. Yeah. So I think it's probably around. The ideas that the community and the collaborators. Much faster, more media kind of revenue from data cells and. From every stream there as well to heavy fees for people that want to use that. So yeah. But yeah, there's that. 

Do do you guys tomorrow do? 

You have any do you wanna chip in or? 

No, you OK? Continue my. So there's another. So yeah, you assume you might have had about the investment in, in, in science and they have kind of securing IP and so on and so. Forth and. There's an interesting set of regulations. Collective investors regulations around collective investment schemes, and if you put in money into a pool of investments and that money is managed by a sort of money manager, which is the way that most investment schemes work, or maybe a delegate? Decisions as as to where. The the money goes, then your regulators collective investment schemes are very high regulatory burdens. Very expensive. But if you have the people. Who put the money in themselves? Choose where the money goes. Void that regulatory burden. And this the plan study is that that's going to the the terms on which a lot of sort of Dow investments. But again, what slightly confuses me and maybe somebody can explain this to me, is that if people putting the money in deciding where the investment should go as a superior way to invest money, why don't investment schemes typically run that basis? Why do they delegate their money matches? What I strongly suspect is. That money managers are simply better at making decisions. As to where? Investments go in terms of maximising the return. And but if you pull all your money in and say OK, like everybody who puts some money and gets votes in proportion to their their contribution, then avoid the investment, effective investment scheme regulation. And so my. Suspicion is, although you know I would be. Very happy to. Improve wrong here. Is that it's simply another case of regulatory arbitrage because you can issue a token. And if you do it that way, and if you have a person managing the the, the, the professional managing where the investments go, which is a. 

OK. 

Superior way to. Invest. You wouldn't be able to issue a. Token because it would be against the regulations. So you. Know maybe again I'm getting the wrong end. Of the stick here, but. It's it's, it's. There's a strong incentive to imply that everybody, seven people pulling their money together and then deciding and votes as to where that money goes is a superior way to invest. But it's confusing. To me, as to why? Because that doesn't apply. Blockchain, of course, that have investment funds for. For hundreds of years, whether they. Never operate that way. Maybe somebody can. If it's a. Superior way to invest. Money. Why don't they do it? Why? 

I mentioned earlier that the American Diabetes Association, they get donations and they they claimed that was responsibility to their to their donors to fund research that. But the reason why testing become increasingly more sceptical than frustration is. Whilst they're gonna be deemed a reliable body to do what they said they would do, it's not actually materialised. So yeah, just whilst investment managers and they have the expertise to do that, the intentions that was the one with the people that, that. 

Yeah, yeah. 

And you could say the same thing for charity. I mean, lots of people give money to Greenpeace. For example, green goes to one thing as far as they know, they don't have all their members voting what they spend the money on. Maybe they do. I'm not. Sure. But I mean the I. Guess the point is that. They could do that if they wanted. If it was. A superior way to manage charity manage. Charitable money or investment. Money or anything. Else then you presume it would have been. Prior to proper blockchain and they that they've been voting since the time of Aristotle. So I I think you know just now. But yeah, maybe there's. 

A different. 

Just listening to Jeff. 

Thank you. 

As well. You know, so again, in the diabetes space, but I think it's a more general point of the money that they raise rates. Interest is when the 5% or before they actually spent on for example research, so. Yeah. So that investigating is another issue and why? I think there needs to. Be alternative structures to invest money. 

Yeah, yeah, absolutely speaking. I mean, I guess I would say that my point is not that I certainly wouldn't dispute that the way that things work currently is often river of corruption and very. 

That there's the huge shortcomings. 

What? I guess what I. Would like to be more convinced of is that this new proposal fixes that previous problem at the end is that second part sometimes. I struggle with. 

Miss Christmas? 

I'm only here. At I'm only here in bits and pieces, but I think from what I'm hearing, there's sort of this question of like is it better to make decisions in a sort of democratic way, or is it better to make decisions with like a trusted group of experts who have this like qualification credential expertise in a particular field? 

Yeah, that's a good, good way. Of putting it, yeah. 

And that maybe that? Leads to better decisions. I think what we've seen. At Bitcoin is that there is. Really, a place for both of these things? And they can really be complementary models. Rather than alternatives to each other. I'll give one example that we've seen in about 3 ecosystem. You know, a good point. Of course, we're really about democratic, letting the group make decisions together, letting the community say what they care about. As a parallel, one of our largest funders is the. Etherium complication and they've. Given us a lot of support and they also support other members of the. 

The theory of. 

Foundation is made of people who are very technical, really deep into what Ethereum means and what exactly should be built, and so they also make funding decisions, and they'll often fund really technical projects back end infrastructure. What we've seen on gate point is that the community will come and they'll fund applications. That wouldn't have necessarily been built. Otherwise, so they funded applications like unit swap, which is something that lets people exchange the tokens they're using really easily. They funded applications like Tornado Cash, which gives people the ability to exchange funds privately. And these weren't necessarily things the Ethereum Foundation was going to fund otherwise. And so there's a difference between what the Community funds and what experts fund and what I think we're seeing is that the best of both worlds is really what we want to be. We want to see like all of these things get funded and we want to. See them getting. Funded proportionally to how much each of those groups cares about. So not that like one's better. I mean, honestly, I mean, if you're making solely investments, it's it's different from funding public goods, but there's probably a time and place for different mechanisms. 

And then just kind of. 

Adding on to. 

Umer's comment there. Like public goods in general basically need. A centralised group. That actually has experts who probably actually think about things longer term. That usually I think what groups in groups of. Experts would go towards. One vote would probably necessarily vote for. So I think if you're thinking. About using just very esoteric examples, right? Like you're Victorian plumbing super important if you ask the average person, are they going to spend, you know, have the ability to think about? Something you know 30 years from now and continue to have the same amount of enthusiasm, probably not. And in that situation you probably. Want to have? A larger body that is charged with ensuring that. You know, we start with the vision and we kind of like get all the way down to actually ensuring the Victorian plumbing is done and the same thing I think is probably true. All building worlds in, you know, web three or being very being able to build utilities and web three to provide for applications to be built on top that allow people to be able to really take. Value from them and those applications can only usually be available once that plumbing, if you will of that infrastructure is put in place. So again, just echoing what we're saying, there is a space for both and I don't think it's easier some game here. 

Yeah. Thank you. Did you have any? Oh, any any questions? 

Just regarding the point about where the decentralised financing may be applicable, it seems can you hear what? 

Because what if I project? I think that they might be hearing. 

I'm trying my best. 

Right. 

If you. 

I'll try. 

Wait. Or someone can? Just read the question.

That's easier. 

Yeah, in that case. 

OK. Just regarding. Definitely both essential expenses solution versus centralising. 

You say about the applications. 

Being the sort. 

Of thing. 

That Dr fencing generates. 

Does it seem like decentralised solutions are the case? Where there are multiple stakeholders involved in fixing the problem and multiple teams. 

And perhaps there. 

Could be a basis of recognising where. Centralised solutions and how those. Should be distributed as according to like when. Multiple different people are sold. In your case the. Medical solutions to patient interaction. Lots of different patients need lots. Of different perspectives to be able. Do these things and most of different people need to get as well as two collaborators. So perhaps that's the key point there where answer, maybe we're entering the stage where solution solving is best achieved through many different factors as opposed to single highly skilled experts and controls. 

Ohh absolutely. So I mean what you're saying that reminds me of the way problems are solved in open source as well they they. Often the sort of problem out there, it's. Kind of, yeah. 

Just sort of. 

Broadcast if anybody had to do this or anyone's interested, they can chip in and sometimes, you know, probably there is even funding right for those people. So I'm certainly not, you know, kind of arguing against the decentralised mechanism. 

Thank you. 

I suppose I. I was thinking about thinking of breakaway points where your family future in open source. Particular structure and project that do very well isn't that the next, and they're sort of they're kind of large code bases, their home modular, they have near term utility and whistles. So not all types of projects and all types of scientific endeavours have those that structure and so don't function well as open source projects. So it's. Funny that people think. Pretty successful is incredibly professional for a very. Narrow category of ties to, then. 

Very successful. 

So it's not open source, isn't? For example, it hasn't become a phenomenon in. 

Science, we haven't come out from. 

And sort of, you know, she was learning how it's become film in very particular types of code bases so. In principle, it's fantastic. You can do it, but you know. 

She's like. 

How do you capture value which is generated? I don't think anyone would dispute these things generate an enormous amount of value in this. 

Do you think that's the reason why so many open source projects get? About it, I'm I'm just not talking about I'm. 

Not suggesting that we're. 

Suggesting that the fee the space associated with open source really is for people who kind of get excited by and then want to continue building specific space. And you know very often libraries. Or groups or projects do get abandoned in the. In space giving it's a value cap tradition. 

So. So they're very long tail of open source projects, which probably knows huge huge. Numbers of of. Open source projects. Vast majority of them. Have sort. Of I think they have a. Median of 1 contributor. And you know, a tiny number sort of a. Handful, you know. 

Thousands and thousands. 

And that's the thing. You can open source anything that you'd like, but it's not. Necessarily a good idea to open source it. And sometimes it's a last resort. Some people just get a bit sick of developing a piece of software and see what happens. Nobody will houses. It's just stays there. And no watches his head. So it it's so you get sort of. A very kind of a. You know a bias towards all the attention of certain types of open. Projects. Most of them aren't. You know are aren't maintained or. You know, we'll get abandoned and you know, the problem is that money, you, you and you have a sort. Of special many. Of these programmes are a special category. Of open source project. And the code. Open source things will never have. Korea transport or if you have a sort of, you know, protein. So again, it's crypto projects on this tiny subset of all, which happens to be able to. But again it's sort. Of unclear as to whether they're. Themselves through people mistaking an investment for whether there is really some value. 

You have a little bit of a simply understanding. It's just better if you said. 

I was listening to everyone mentioned, I mean, all this generally stems from the democratisation of of sources of funding, or these just the voting ourself. I think the simplest thing to understand is simply that open. Source is only going. To be a problem if. You're talking about. Because a lot of times the open source thing is essentially open source services or. But it is the real question is about whether that open source contribution. Method is intended to produce something of a median commercial value if it isn't. Then it's OK that's generally OK. You just expect people. 

To vote. 

Even if that's just $1.00 each their community, even consider having everybody be called stakeholders, right? Let's say someone they say 100,000 bucks and no one. If each quantum generally have one, the. Same glowing copper for what they're pitching. Then they don't really have the commercial stake in anything. It's just what they feel is the gratuity to worth, that an issue, then that's coalition that that policy is completed and then someone is going to generate the output in line with the decision between. So that really shouldn't have any problem at all. Personal point of view, because like at this point, we're talking about speculative commercial building, right? Is the is the prospect for it to actually generate? 

Also the value. 

That people shouldn't be going into assuming that we're actually going to get some money or even the guys waiting on our decision. But if you have a different actor. So it's really all the. Business model it's you have an enterprise that literally says. We will try to make. Something a part of the service. That is intended to make money. Then I think at that point you really should have a pure democracy, if you will. Fishing boating club at that point. I mean, you could run it that way. You could run that way. But wait, things are generally done. Saying that, oh, I want to. I have just to maybe provide contracts on academic moves in the university say this is a sponsored project. We have two PhD students involved and whenever you create something for us to sort of capitalise on, that's how it works with. So that's because we've already got someone who's going to be exploited in that way. I think the real understanding so like it doesn't matter whether something is open source or not, it really matters as to whether that open source or method is intended to create something or exploration or you know that right, because otherwise you really care about. 

OK. 

Care about where the outside big. 

Right, yeah, yeah. But otherwise you have to be where? 

You have more votes than. 

Facebook chairs when you have one Facebook chair because. 

Your your e-mail makes sense because your your your. 

Your investment is impacted in proportion to the number of votes. They've been trying to do a public good thing, which is being a democratic expecting. 

There, there shouldn't be. The only time if it was a pure democratic. Thing I would assume that the initiative that. Vote for this. If it is not speculative. Then you need to. 

Have something like an expandable public. Basically say. 

You need to emulate what's happening in the United States like you do. We need some sort of hard working because I think as. There's no saying that. You can't do something without any kind of like. Hierarchy of authority. And that's going to be, I would call it this. A constitution of. Of practise really. So the practise. Focused deployment right? Someone has to make sure that everything was done correctly. Someone has to be related to them and operate them the way the the operation cost and manpower. At the end of the day, you have to centralised or establish some sort of hierarchy for the processes of that business. 

OK. 

Even if it isn't really because it's. Just an exploration, right? It's some media from some research and then you. Can find people. Outwards, you don't need a higher government on the list that has stick. It's at that point, people. They have different states. And at that point, their state is going to be a direct correlation to the voting power. So for beauty agreement, like for example, it's one person, one vote. 

But then he. 

Got immediately. Assume that the people voting, submitting their votes don't need to be experts, don't need. 

To know a damn thing. 

It's just what the layman wants to do, because otherwise it wouldn't have an opportunity. 

To influence research. 

Or science in an area that might affect that? Maybe there. Is some. Obscure disease that they need help on, but he's always going to capitalise on that. Maybe half pitching millions, right? So that's. 

So what? But the thing that I. Think is most interesting here I'm I'm. 

Right. 

Sorry, it's very hard to be able to. Tell when to. Come in or not, especially if you're on. 

The phone here. 

But it doesn't. It it doesn't have to be either or right? The impression I the impression I. Have is that the way? Every single Dow has basically set up their governance completely differently. Where in some Dows you do have one voice, one vote, and some you don't. And you know the ability for you to be able to have, you know how you do value capture, how you do incentives, how you do incentive matching. I think all kind of really can be determined base by based on specific problem that we're trying to solve in. That particular. So the piece that I'm kind of a little. Bit lost on and maybe I might have. Just missed thing, it's very. Hard to to hear on the phone. Is that why are we talking about it in such a large level? Are we trying to solve all? Of these side are. We trying to say. Like, you know, decentralised science is the way forward. How do we determine that together? Or are we attempting to just figure out how do? We solve for specific problem. Because like I. Can see the desire to have grand architecture. But like the. 

Group is too small to be able. 

To make that decision, you're kind of almost better. Off trying to say OK. There may be larger pieces that we can that. Require some centralised some centralization which there's a larger web tech question about. You know, what do you do with centralization? How do you centralised A decentralised organisation you know and we we we talked about that at nauseam last year and some smaller projects that can be one. 

So again. 

I'm a. Bit bit confused as. To the the the aim. That you're you're trying to reach out. Really. 

My only point is just that we need to know what? What we're trying to decentralise and why. It wouldn't just. Be like any matter. What I'm trying to make the distinction of is that at the end of the day, all these. Things need to have some sort. Of economic value and that they people aren't actually expecting economic value. 

Right. 

Then it is simply easier at that point to just have a fully democratic process and someone else will. 

Right. 

Take on the verdict. Even if they are funding, it's up to them that will be their centralised decision to say we've got this many like. We put out word to the community, truly philanthropic, potentially, and based on what they say, we will just deploy those resources and conduct the research that they need, and then we'll talk about the capitalization afterward. That's again a type, right? That's what people aren't expecting anything to begin with. They just want the information we can. But you can't do that for things that already have the market demand, because then you got to now think about the funding and. Then the person. 

That will be carrying. 

On the work for you is at higher risk. It's not there in competition with other people that may not be using this kind of method of funding. There will be sort of. So these kind of announces may be like that's. Why the careful? Deployment of these kind of democratisation or decentralisation methods is very key. Otherwise it's just sort of. 

Yes. And I feel like. Agree with you. And then that's when you're large. Incentive large incentives, large groups thinking about. What does funding? Public goods and what does you know, funding the comments really look like, you know, there's that they're large conferences that, you know, have a lot of doubts. You know, organisations that basically docket organisations and for profit organisations that are looking at being able to build protocols, get together, talking primarily about, you know, if. They are public goods. How do we? Ensure that those public goods. Are, you know, funded for in some sort of centralised way with? Some kind of garments? And hierarchy for that very reason. 

So yeah. 

Your point around as records among. 

That if there's a decision or process that will be your not getting monetised then you shouldn't have that. No, I'm saying. 

This scheme that they use. So let's say for example. Let's say in the case of, right, that's. 

One of your main. 

But it costs something. Like that. Now, if that's the area that. You want to solve. You've already said that fluency, right? Which means they didn't vote upon that because something that you would have received wanted from the community and are saying they were. Trying to enforce this. Did that come in the form of? 

But we we we communicate. 

Afterwards. So like at this stage, like when you do have the doubt, well, they already established directions. The gaps that. 

The diabetes meeting face because the industry. Is not the. So they'll vote on what they actually perfect, right? So now when they, let's say, someone comes in and says I bought this many servants, right, and the traditional schemes that it's very, very fast. 

And just the word is very interesting time. She needs to start on time. So before you complete this really. Massive thank you to the to the how. Thank you, Sir, and thank you. For joining. Thank you all. It was hard to. 

Hear, but I'm so glad to be. Able to hear some of it and if anyone? Has or wants to engage them more? Feel free to. Ping me on telegram that mark on. 

Fantastic. And just before you start, Connie, there's a few drinks. So just to keep everyone keep everyone in. 

Right. 

I'm going to hand out free drinks in a second, so please, I'll come. Down and help you say thank you. For the idea I'm going to. If you look at the audience, if this works. Can you hear me OK? 

I can hear you. Yes, I can. 

Great. We can hear you perfectly and. 

And mixing. 

That's good. Doing very well with this hybrid technology. 

Sorry, just that's just that you're here and paying attention. 

OK, that's fine. 

Thanks very much. So I'll let. You introduce yourself, if that's OK. 

Yeah, I'll try and share my. Screen if that's OK. 

Perfect. 

Can you see? Hang on. I'm just trying now. Can you see? See the screen OK. 

Yeah, that's great. 

OK, wonderful. So I'll, I'll make a start then. So thank you. So much. Thank thanks. I'm so sorry that I actually can't be there in person and I TuneIn virtually today it it sounded like a really fascinating discussion before. So I hope you're having a wonderful event in Cambridge. I'm really pleased. Thank you so much, Dan and to the organisers. Invited me to actually speak about the research data alliance, otherwise known as the RA, and our involvement also in standards as it's probability to introduce myself. My name is Connie Clare. I'm the Community development manager at the Research Data Alliance. My role is to facilitate the growth of develop. And the global RV community. So I actually didn't create a lot of these lines they've already created for me by Hillary. Heather, how our secretary general and I have adapted that, but I do hope that Dan is maybe somebody you know, with the organising committee can maybe distribute them. I think it might be nice to my contact details are in the slides. And there are also some important links that maybe the audience would like to access. 

So before I begin. 

With the presentation, I'd just like to say that this event that you're all here at. Today is actually. Part of the RA's 10th anniversary series of events. So 2023 is quite an important milestone for the RU community. We're celebrating our 10th birthday and what we've done is actually put together a series of thematic events and activities. From February to November, so we've got 10 months to celebrate 10 years of the research data. Lion and I would like to invite you if you're interested to click the link in the slides when you get there to have a look at the online schedule of the banks, anyone can join that you don't have to be a member of the Research Data Alliance. And also if you have an event that you would like to promote and publicise. Amongst the global. Community. You're also welcome in our year for an event. And throughout the rest of the year. So in the next 10 minutes or so, I'm. Going to give you. A bit of an insight into the research data alliance. I'll talk a little bit about how we're related to standards and then I'll share a couple of examples of projects that we've also been involved in with regard to interoperability. 

Right. 

So for those that you don't know about our vision mission and values, the RDA is a global consensus based as is newly driven organisation and it comprises more than 13,000 international data experts who are our Members. We're also supported by more than 80 organisational and affiliate members from 35 regional networks and 148 countries around the world. So as if global as possible at the moment. And all of the organisations and the members share our vision and mission and the values and see the value and importance of good research, data management, data sharing and their use. The work of the community. Is achieved by community groups and I'll explain the different types of groups that we have. We have more than 100 active groups at the moment and they're responsible for creating these deliverables, so these are the flagship recommendations and outputs that are openly available for adoption of reuse. And I think we have well over 75. And I think that figure actually needs to be updated. So our vision at the RDA is to provide this global, but also a neutral platform to bring different stakeholders together so that researchers, innovators, data. Quarters to I say openly, but we can't always share everything openly as you know, but to share and reuse data where possible across technologies, disciplines and countries to address the grand challenges of society and our mission is for the Community to build the social and technical bridges that enable this. Sharing and reuse of data. And with this. In mind, we. Have 7 guiding principles that are really the foundation of everything that we do within the organisation. So the first one being openness, that means that the RA is open to anybody who is interested in who will adhere to the guiding print. Pools the working meetings of the community groups are open to all RA members and our deliverables. So the recommendations and outputs are always openly available. As I mentioned, for adoption of meat use, we're consensus based, which means that for the RA to progress with procedures in place, a certain processes, we need to be able to achieve what we want to achieve. With agreement and consensus across the community. We take an inclusive, broader, balanced approach to the work that we do and to our membership as much as possible. And I think this harmonisation guiding principle is very important for standards and interoperability, and that basically means that what we're looking to do is align standards, policies, technologies, infrastructure and. Communities to enhance the progress but also avoid the indication of. Where community driven so we have this bottom up, grassroots community of volunteers that are driving and directing the work of the RDA, but with the support of the Secretary Act and finally we are nonprofit and technology neutral and what that means is that we don't promote sell or rentals commercial products, but that all of the deliverables that we create as I mentioned. Are available to anybody to adopt and reuse. So the community groups are what we like to call the beating heart of of the RDH. So we would not have the research data aligned without the Members and without the groups that are achieving the work. And we've got these three different types of groups. The first one is the working groups. So this has a finite lifespan and it's really targeting. Towards developing concrete deliverables within that time frame, so this would be the develop. And implementation of tools, policy practises and products that are about data management, but they can that can be tangibly and concretely implemented or adopted by organisations, projects and communities. So the average time frame for a working group is 12 to 18 months to actually achieve a deliverable. And and we have currently 42 active working groups. The next type of group is an interest group and this is quite broad. It's a bit broader in scope than a working group, so it's about solving a more high level data sharing problem and actually identifying the infrastructure or the type of work that is needed to solve that problem. So this might actually give rise. To new working. Groups that are developing those tools policies. And processes. The interest group doesn't have a lifespan, so it can go on indefinitely for as long as the group is as interested and active to the community and within the community. The the interest group doesn't really produce recommendations as such, but can produce some kind of output such as guidelines or best practises, and we have to. The activity and transcripts at the. And the final type of group is a community of practise and this was newly established within the RA in 2020 and these have a domain or a disciplinary focus. So we currently have one community of practise at the moment on agricultural data. A community practise in broader again from an interest group. So the idea is that this would. They would would play a coordination or an awareness raising role. 

With it. 

In the yard. But also externally, so we call this an umbrella group because it's covering the overarching that the various different groups within the RDA. But it also has a role to engage with external stakeholders and external disciplinary communities outside of the RDA. And again, the lifespan of a community in practise is indefinite, so we can go on for as long as it's active. But there is a. Review every 18 months and the outcome of of of community of practise would be the generation of new disciplinary working groups and interest groups and also as I mentioned, building bridges internally within the RA and also externally. And just to reiterate, sort of the structure. So Hillary likes to call this the RDO family. And I quite like the way that that's described because it is these different sort of levels and different stakeholders that come together to, to basically make the Community work. So we have the individuals, as I mentioned for more than 13,000 from 148 different countries. And these are the strategic think tanks. So these are the data experts that are coming from their own research institutions to stimulate and drive this constructive dialogue and collaboration on themes related to data management. They're bringing their institutional perspective, but also their cultural perspectives and also presenting the latest research results from their area. So these are the members of the groups and the coaches that are leading the groups collaborating and producing the recommendations and outputs. Then to reiterate also, we have the organisations and I think that the RA provides quite a novel opportunity and it's one of the few places where organisational methods have different researchers data management. Information professionals from different organisations can come together to directly interact and collaborate to develop solutions and best practises that can be adopted, customised and implemented within their own different research settings. And then we also have these, the national and regional level, the different regions that come together as part of the regional assembly within the RDA to. Really enhance this global perspective to share practises to share their challenges and their needs and also success stories and lessons learned so that across the globe we can learn together and achieve efficiency and also reduce this duplication of efforts and avoid reinventing the wheel in various places. And it's important to think also that the regions then. And then take these recommendations and outputs to their local level. Implement them you know, with in different languages and also change things culturally, but also infiltrate, you know, their own networks with with the RA and vice versa. So I think it's quite. I now just want to talk quite briefly now about the research data reliance and also standardisation or standards. So the processes that the audience has, I've actually been modelled on the Internet Engineering task force. So as I mentioned earlier, these deliverables are created by the Community groups and then they go out to community reviews for one month whereby they'll be comments from the Community and the possible revisions and iterations. We also invite the organisational assembly, so all of these different organisations organisation to provide an expert commentary if they're interested, and we do also require that the recommendations and the outputs are also adopted by two independent organisations before they can be endorsed. By the RTA Council, so it's quite a rigorous and stringent process that we have in place to get recommendations endorsed. The Research Data Alliance isn't actually a standard development organisation, but we do comply with the standards bodies and in 2017 the multi stakeholder platform did approve the RA organisation to issue standards and technical specifications and at that time we did have eight RDS recommendations that were approved. As I've seen, team technical specifications and when I share these slides with you, you'll be able to see through the links what those were. And of course, going back to our guiding principle of harmonisation, we really do want to try and standardise across the board as much as possible the data, standards, policies, technologies, infrastructure and communities, so so that we can avoid, you know, reinvention. Of the wheel. And I think a really good example of what the RA can do in. With regards to standardisation and harmonisation and to reduce the silos, in this example of an adoption story of the RDP for trust seal across domains and regions, so as some of you will know, the core trust SEAL offers interested data repository is an opportunity to become certified as a trustworthy repository based on requirements and standards. And in this particular example, what we see is the data seal of approval, which was largely serving the social sciences and humanities and also the world data system, which was largely serving Earth and space sciences. They came together under the umbrella of an RDA working group to actually harmonise their current data repository. Notifications and the outcome was the core trust your standards and as we know, that serves a larger proportion of the research data community and the wider variation of disciplines. Also thinking about what the organ can do to help with standardisation going forward. So at the moment we are in the process of developing and drafting our strategic plan for the next five years. 

OK. 

And as part of that we're in, we're also in the process of developing and implementing a new web platform, which will hopefully provide the technical infrastructure we need to improve the quality and the maintenance of recommendations and outputs going forward. We also want to support the preparation of standards for open science and research, data management and within that we're hoping to, in the future assist more RA groups with standard processes and procedures, creating an RSA standardisation route, possibly, and maintaining standards for the community where appropriate, and I think it's important to be mindful. That if we do go down the standardisation route, what we don't need to do is certify and approve our own our own standards, so we will have to think about how that will go in the future. And now I'd just like to share a couple of examples of interoperability projects. So some of you might know about world fair. So this is a project that is led by Co data and also the Research Data alliance along with other organisations to create recommendations, interoperability frameworks and guidelines for their data assessment. Across various different disciplines. So we're working with 11 disciplinary and cross disciplinary case studies and you can see the examples and the range here from chemistry to social sciences. To agriculture and biodiversity through to cultural heritage, the idea is to advance the implementation of the fair data principles within these different disciplines, but also improve interoperability within and across disciplines, and the reusability of digital research objects and namely data. So the 8:00 here is to harmonise initiatives. Researching management, Dave Stewardship affair through this code design of instability frameworks. Now I myself am not personally involved in the World Fair Project, but if anybody has any questions and would like to follow afterwards I'd be happy to put you in contact with my colleagues. Within the Rd. And the final. Example of interoperability that I'd like to share with you is quite an interesting one by disco, so that stands for the distributed system as scientific collections. So this is. A world class research infrastructure for natural science collections. So these are physical samples or collections. That are present. Within Natural History museums, botanical gardens, universities, and research institutes. 

And a key. 

Aspect of disco and what they've done is to develop this digital specimen. So what? This is in simple terms, is essentially A surrogate or a digital version, a digital representation of a physical sample. As you might appreciate, physical samples aren't necessarily very accessible. They're not always easy to borrow or to visit, but they're not really linked to all the data. Mine so this digital sample is in. Totally to be more fair, so more findable, accessible, more interruptible, and more reusable. And the digital specimen that was developed was based on two recommendations that were developed by groups within the RA. So a summary of virtual layer recommendations. So this describes how to establish a comprehensive network. Of components for managing digital object. And then this second recommendation here, the basic vocabularies and metadata standards for attribution of physical and digital collection stewardship. That's a bit of a mouthful, so that basically is a recommendation to improve metadata. And tracking the. Provenance in the curation and maintenance of research collections so you can also visit that. I think that is the last example that I was going to share with you today. So on that note, I'm afraid I can't hang around today because tuning in virtually I've I've actually got a young child upstairs, but I need to go put to bed now. But if you do have any questions, please do reach out to me and it's been a pleasure to present today. So I will stop sharing and I hope you enjoy the networking and the rest of the evening. 

Thank you very much. 

Having me. 

So does everyone. Know what fair means? Fair data verification data has. 

Us converted. 

That's right, final accessible interruptible. We have the script. So thank you very much for agreeing to give that the last day. So there's pizza coming at 8:00 o'clock. So if you seen Rush Outdoor, I'm going to go through some and I will be. 

Turning it. What's that? 

This is very interesting. 

OK. The last. 

And I want to. 

Creating and publishing interoperable objects. Talk to you about a decentralised nodes. And just to begin to. 

Give a. 

Little bit of a motivation as we all know, the the current scientific publishing model is basically rooted in the principles of the printing press that they impacted the 15th century, which basically means. We have started Richard version of Records and basically our publishing model for digital papers essentially PDFs that publishers put on websites, often like a wall. 

And then there is. 

A very limited amount of data, data and we. Have UIS that are supposed to be persistent identifiers, whereas the not I have. 

OK. 

But essentially it means that we only have an. 

Infrastructure for this. 

And that means that we will be trying to. 

Be as data. Our last and hidden or scattered around. And we have very limited possibilities to interact. With them and to reuse them. So in the future, what we'd like to have is basically an open and creative record of versions for these sphere digital research objects, where as we just learned here, stands for findable, accessible, interoperable and. So to motivate. 

The transition that. 

Let's think of what the paper of the. Future should actually look like. So it should be much. More than just the static, yeah. Ideally you would have a paper that is directly linked to the data and the codes that create the main results being reported in the paper. So for example the. Main figure should be linked to the the code that generated it. You should be able to not only look up the code, you should be able to run it. You should actually be able to. Easy reproducibility cheques integrity. That, of course, like that is currently missing. In here in. The infrastructure that that we're having, I think that's actually one of the big problems that contributes to the replication crisis that we have in many fields. In addition to that, you should be able to actually interact. With the with the other components. Of that. Right, so you should be able to. Reuse the data. And to reduce the code to pull. It into your compute environment or ideally to just also just send to compute jobs and run it on the data that actually lives as a part of the interactive research object. And of course. 

There can be peer. 

Review attached to it and annotations and so on. And so forth. So that's really how we're thinking about it. And that's ultimately what application allows. Us to do. And I'll show you how. That how that works in practise. But let's talk a little bit about. The the technology. That is under the hood and in. Particular the the data structure. That is underlying it so essentially. Each research object consists of various components, so that can be data, can code can be, videos can be all different sorts of things, and each of these components is being stored on this decentralised. Network that that I've talked about. And it actually has a unique content address that is derived from a cryptographic hash. So it's basically the content is run through a cryptographic hash function that generates a unique hash for that particular piece of content which identifies that. And then. Basically all these things are linked together to the root node of the research object, which also has the link path which is a combination of the hashes of the components that are. Included in the research object. And essentially what you have here is a data structure that is a Merkle pack, so that basically turns each research. Object into a little knowledge graph. And when you publish that research object, you don't only make it available, but what happens is that the root. Hash of the research object is actually being indexed on a blockchain smart contract. Which then provides Providence. About who has created this, what and when. And you can actually version that thing. So if you upload a new component or you update a part of your research project, let's say you have a new version of the manuscript, then what happens is not that you overwrite the old version but that. You create a. New version and every time that the new version. As being published, the new entrance is being written into that public lecture. Which tells you the most recent hash address of the research object. So that way you really have. A version of ability of these interactive research. Now what happens in the data layer is that. The moment that. You and your authors have decided that it's about time that you can actually share your. Work with the. World and in my personal opinion you can start with. It early enough. So once you have such a dynamic infrastructure. I think actually an optimal way. To do that is that you start really early on, maybe with the first analysis plan and then you add the first data set and some code later and the first manuscript later. 

So the. 

Ideally, the the living dynamic thing that gets updated and that. Goes over time. But then you say, OK, I'm going to share this with the world. What happens is that you leave the private people have created the research object with your, with your authors, and you basically push it onto the network. And what happens in that moment is that in that network there will be at least five identical copies. Of that inserted object. Being created. Going to be stored. By at least. Three different storage providers, meaning that there is. Also, no window locked in. 

And it's going to be. 

Units and available and stored on servers that are located in these three different countries in two different continents. And this is. Our network actually. Has the capacity to store literally petabytes of data, and you can do that. It's extremely competitive prices thanks to the competitive marketplace for storage. Buyers into cryptographic incentives would like subsidised. Early adoption of the network. All data sharing and data publications actually become what we currently have is a open data that is available. If you guys can test everybody where you use it. There's already publications that people have done on the platforms. 

So a couple of weeks ago. And at the moment. 

What you can do is you can upload up to 30. Gigabytes of data for free and for each. Friend, you invite you basic. Just 5 gigabytes. And then very soon we will basically have onboarding ramp for for really large data sets. So we like terabytes. Or petabytes of data. And for these very large data sets, making them available is the substantial cost. Actor for scientists. We recently had an example where. A colleague of mine from the Broad Institute. Were attacked about four terabytes of data that was so the paper was published 2 years ago in in ancient genetics. And a lot of people. In the community were using it. And the problem was. Not really storing the data. The problem was that the data was so popular that people downloaded it a lot, so that. Created a lot. So he actually ended. Up with over $100,000 in US cost just because he had this very popular paper that everybody. Had you know, wanted to. So he was like, OK. Problem like I don't have the money for this either. We need to find a solution or I. Need to shut. Down access to the data. So she shut down access to the data and now he actually brings all the data and all the work that he's done with this entire line over to the site, to the site. So in the future when we will basically have. Types of for for scientific data publications. Hot storage, meaning that the the data is going to be immediately available. You can run compute. Jobs on it. 

And so on so forth. 

And there is going to be an option for title stores where the data is not going to be immediately available, but maybe with one but. An incredible team going to be like. Cost savings of about 9999% egress fees are included in that and also have a sponsorship programme. Through the foundation were very large and very valuable scientific data sets can actually be stored. OK, so there's actually a number of sort of superpowers that the the data structure and the identifier that they have in the system before. So you can actually run operations. On these identifiers and we call Dpid centralised system identifiers, basically based on the content address and these hashes that the. So the first one is of course you can resolve the meta data. But even more importantly. 

In the future. 

The use them as addresses to send. And if you run compute jobs on the data word. On the server where the data is already stored. So that's a huge advantage specifically for very large data sets. So if you have data dozens. Or even hundreds of you. 

Don't really want to move them around. 

At least for. 

Two reasons. One of them is that very slow. The second one is that. Very expensive to move around, so This is why in computer science people often say that you know. Data has gravity. So if you have a very large. Data set you. Sort of bring everything else to that server rather than sending it around. So that it will be possible and it has this other advantage that all of a sudden if you will all have problems about what kind of confusions have already. Been done and who has won the content? So that's another. Possibility to actually have. Efficiency gains in this kind of system. And of course you can. Actually use these DPI IDs also to just import the resources of the computer environment. You can use the command and basically pull data into your environment. And finally, you can also use them to send attestations to the research complex. So with our attestation to think of them as things like badges that characterise specific attributes, that object has some valuable attributes that you would actually like to know this. Is the data. Does the corner there? Does the code actually run on the? Data are the results reproducible? Has this work in peer review? Has it been published? All of these could be different types of applications that can be sent through research object and that will then be surfaced invisible to anybody who will actually use that research. Now let me talk a little bit more about the essential line. The system identifier thing, so. Just a little bit. This is all connected in computer science called triangle. So Zuko wrote a paper in 2001 that basically specifies desirable properties that the system identifier should have, so it should be secure against malicious. It should be decentralised, meaning that it should. Not be in the. Hands of a of a single. Authority, so it should. Basically, there should be no single. Point of failure and. There should be no way for a single entity. To actually manipulate this is an identifier should be through decentralisation. To actually basically make it make it possible to publish certain types of content. And then third, it should be human. And Google sex VAX. It is theoretically impossible to have all of these three parts. So that you have to make a design decision and you can have. At most two out of three. Then, ten years later, the. The famous Aaron. Schwartz paper and then you basically have to be ready. 

OK. 

To prove that said that that he's to to. Some extent he can actually. Have all three of these properties. Now the GUID is that that we develop and that are underlying the design system, they're. 

Actually sort of like attractive. 

The solution to use was triangle, so they're secure because they're they're based on these, they're decentralised, so there is no single point of failure. There is no single authority is basically just an algorithm that is calculating the hash function. And then. Human meaningful the passions are not human meaningful, right? So hashes are beautiful for machines. They love them. But for us humans they fear meaning. So what we did is we took like a Bitly shortening version. Meaning so. That you can actually. No, immediately. When you look at the DPD, what? Is this addressing and and what it means? And through the system, we basically have preservation. You have apartments. We have interoperability. And in contrast, the fuel ice system that is currently. Being used it. Actually fulfils none of these requirements, so it's it's neither secure nor centralised. Nor in the meaningful. It's not within the system, and it's not even about 50% of your eyes do not correctly, but also the underlying resource and whether they. 

And then what? 

They was involved in was actually a function. Of the computer environment and the request method which. Means that you can get drastically different responses for resolving it in your eye. Let's say if you try that from the computer to the Cambridge, or if you're gonna mobile. You'll quite likely not get through. So I think this is actually quite forward and yeah, so we're we're thinking of this atomic unit of the future publishing the. Research context or at the floor. It has data storage on this content and the storage network. This completely essential layer. Each research object you have, Jason and D compliant hash based meta data and we have these these fields which are actually globally unique, resolvable permanent identifiers. That also allow us to run operations. 

If you will. 

Worries about accusations and and credit governments. So I already said that in the system you can actually send at the station to research objects. In principle, anyone can can send these applications but. Obviously they're they're going to be particularly. Valuable. They come from trust, the Third Point. So you can think for example of universities or publishers or organisation that's actually development issues that are at the station when. You send them. And in addition, we're also thinking about basically bringing. Primitives to to the way that that. Science has been encountered. So the things that very similar to when you're when you're having a software development. Project on GitHub for you. Before emerge cold here, it will be possible to basically forward and merge. So let's say you you have research object from the thing scientist published here and then some kids in India finds a way to. Actually improve their. Object they're saying like, you know, interesting analysis or by. Adding additional information that makes. The data the metadata error. So then what they can do? Is they can basically send, they can create a. Forward with the. 

Research object and. 

They can send the match request to the original. President of the original authors like. And then there is a merge and the the contributor became basically becomes a. Contributor to people. While counting them as a as a contributor. 

So another thing that. 

That we're trying to solve here. Is really that we want to create a. Much better user experience than we. Currently have so. The way that that scientific publishing currently works is of course that. You know. That is really buggy submission forms with the publishers. They don't support the data storage. You have to go somewhere else and that you will implement it in your manuscript. So instead, actually what we have is. That's all. Is a really smooth and very intuitive. User interface that allows the researchers to integrate. And to use all the tools that they want. Directly into this environment. So obviously the the goal of this is to make science much more transparent and accessible, and an important part of that is that the entire project is, of course, the open source software project. Actually confined and did have already at design apps, there's already quite an. Active developer community there. 

And now I'm. 

Just going to draw you quickly in. Like in practise? Yes. OK. So this is the. So it's. You can use it from. Any device that is connected to the Internet. And what I'm. Showing you here this is. A node financial. The project officer and the open science. Team the Casa. And she she actually published one for papers from a PhD here on design. 

And it's a really, really. 

Spectacular paper because she has really gone the extra. Mile to make sure. That every single finding in her paper is reproducible, even though this paper is already. 

Sending this poll. 

And now in principle it it looks. Like a normal. You know. And actually you can download it and you can print it. 

Be careful. 

And basically all the. Components of the research context they're accessible. Here through the. Menu on the site so you see there's. A quote repository, which is basically. For from GitHub you have the data. So it's. Basically folders. We can browse the data and you can download them. 

But what is? 

Really cool is that there is now these interactive features. So if we go to to Figure 1 figure. One actually has an annotation that. Allows us to reproduce that, so we can just click this here. And pull up the code that. That create the figure and you can actually report it. That's the the idea of these one. Click reproducibility runs. And then here is an example. Of an attestation that was sent to this research. Object. So this one says that it's an. Author collaboration. So the. The node has actually been. Created by a nodes forward and. That also has. Collaborated and and gotten input from from the authors. And then you basically see the the history of of those things. So you see that there were basically five different versions that are published. You can browse. Through the various versions and see what changes have occurred, and then you finally have keywords and meta data. And I'm just going to. Show you very. Quickly. So here is an old paper that. That I published. A couple of years. Ago where I've now created an. I just wanted to show you what this. Feels like when you're the author. So you basically have the no drive. So this is very simple. Drop offs slide where you. Can just very easily add components. So you say add component when you. Choose what type? Of component it is and you. Can just upload it. Or enter an ID and then if you want to basically link the table or figure to the underlying data. This is super easy so. You would just say. Create annotation and you. Area that you were that you want to annotate and then you have a pop up menu. Here we can either type in some text or you can directly connect it to one of the components that that are part of the research object. You can also code. There in latex. So this is what this currently feels like and you can actually find this and you can use this on nose and people love to get feedback from anybody who. Save up time. Once we try this out. OK. And with that, I just. 

Want to? 

Wanted to to give a shout out to. 

Our great team. 

You can find us on Twitter at TFI lab and e-mail at dci.com. And one thing that I also wanted to mention is that the has the future of science and podcast series. Where we already have. A bunch of. Like, really amazing. Speakers and yeah, so the the latest one. Was actually Daniel hope. The CEO of digital science. We also have. 1 shape and several other great people. And yeah, I really recommend that. Thanks to you for your attention. And if you have some questions and comments from you. 

But the question I have for for scientists why would they use something which allows people access to their information templates and plans for their papers in advance? Of the publication. And while they do this over this platform versus. 

Yeah. Yeah, so, OK, so these are two. Different questions. So I think like for for people. That are concerned about, you know, getting their ideas stolen. There is. No need that. That you actually need to to put your analysis plan on, right. So this is you can put that on the app and you can have a time. That's not an answer, so this is not the primary privilege this. This platform, I'm just saying. That if you don't have that concern, you can do that. Then you can actually. Build your research on people. This publication platform is entirely compatible with publishing and high prestige journals. In fact, I think that this should actually increase the amount of of getting into a top drama, because you're making it so much easier for referees and for editors to actually cheque that. Resources on there and what your results are. 

The reproducible. 

So anything that? Is being put onto that platform is. Team published basically under Creative Common Plan, which means that you as the author. You're still in. Control of your of your copyrights and it's. Completely up to you. To decide where you publish it. 

See you. One of the advantages you mentioned is schooling and doing large amount of data and I I'm assuming that you must be using a cloud. 

Well, it's. 

On the zone. 

Well, so let's go back here to this. The skill. So actually. So there's two parts. Of the system so. There's the private staging area, which is basically this little South and the top, and this is currently so that the private staging area. Currently we're running it on. 

Right. 

But what happens when the publisher? Is basically create these these various identity. And copies on the. I give us some PowerPoint. And that's a decentralised basically compute network. It's a it's an open source software system that anybody can install on their computer or on their server as a. Participate in the system. And this already has, like an enormous. I think you've already like. 

And you may. Share without any charges as well as that, and having also part of this open network. 

OK. Yeah. 

OK. So we are leveraging the capability. Of that network. So. 

Exactly. That's exactly, yeah, yeah. 

What do you think about the issue one? One thing I've noticed seriously with. The kind of a lot of. Talk about AI is that you know. Google and open AI that. Publishes papers in nature and sort. 

Of journalists, and they definitely don't. 

Have the data available. That's almost by definition. They simply say we have some project. Anything we did this and then this where our results? Yeah, I mean, this seems to be like the way that way and why science is going so this. So the scientists actually don't want you to be able to reproduce their results otherwise. 

You know what? 

I mean right? It's like they have a competitive. Advantage since then? 

They publish further pages and public public. 

Yeah, I mean this. Unfortunately, I think you're right. So I think that the the incentives that we that we currently have and assigned. 

To the ecosystem, they're. 

Not really well aligned. With the with the goals. Of actual, you know, scientific, creative, very questionable incentives. Including the intent to just publish. A loss and to publish ***\***** that. He hacking and. 

You know to. 

To basically claim. Same results and it sounds super flashy and fancy, but then? Not be able to pick it up. 

Right. 

And and also the scientific publishers, they don't really have an infrastructure to really cheque these things, right. So at the moment basically as a referee, the only thing that that you really cheque is the the manuscript party. Anybody ever looks at the data of the code because these things are not even available. Right. But. 

Harry sat down. 

There's a lot of like initiative from from various. 

Parts of the academic community. 

That's trying to change that. Not these from the scientists itself, right? So you open science and this, of course, is an attendance from scientists themselves. To actually change that and change the. Culture around them. 

And there's a lot of. 

A lot of traction there's. More and more people following. It and now at the same time we have policy. Neighbours who are actually requesting these things and that are making it funding. Requirements, right, so we we have. The White House memoir was published for years now basically requires that any federally funded research needs to be immediately publicly available, and that actually also extends to the underlying research. 

Thomas, 5. 

Artefacts such as. The thing is that there is no infrastructure for this. As we'll get and. 

Question. But the product is more like the.

Structure and data management. 

Which can be built into that technology. So. What is the specific role of using the blockchain? 

Yeah. So that's a good question. So I think the the watching comes at a various points. So one is this absolutely essential for us to have these persistent identifiers because we're alternately the the superpower that we have here is this content of content. In this story. Which is at the heart of the. Less than 5.4. But that's that. Really. What? Allows us to have a persistent identifier that has these characteristics that allow us to have these dynamic variables. And that actually have programmability and interoperability, right? So this is really. Absolutely essential to have that. To have fear, right? So fear this, this principle of like findable, accessible is optimal reusable. It requires persistent identifiers. And as I said earlier. On that. So with the current system like we turn it impossible. The second thing is that it actually makes the data storage so much cheaper and better, and then that it creates it allows us to basically create this meta data record off all the lines being created and published on the system, which is then being indexed on the block where you basically have this public vector of what has been. Created by whom? And? And that also means. That publishers cannot actually forward that meta data and sell it back to the scientific institutions to make money from it. But it's that all the data is out there and then you can basically have service providers that have software that indexes and analyses that that mean that everything that. It's not. It is not. Shut it off and it's not. 

Yeah, so I upload my I want to upload my data. There's 100 gig bags that we are OK, do your plans to shift that to. 

Yeah, so I mean. There's two. Things that. We can actually. Do here so one is. So the ideas and five boxes, and there's actually there is actually. So it's it's a little complicated how that works, but ultimately if you want to participate as a storage provider, you are eligible to collect certain. 

We frequent. 

Rewards for storing data, but then the data actually there's sort of like there's an algorithm that automatically cheques if the data that you said you would. Score is available. And in order to participate in that system, you. Have to put down. And if you don't fulfil your requirements, that collateral gets slashed, right? So it's sort of that's the economy. 

For actually hosting. 

Data from the service providers currently very, very lucrative so. 

What we can do? 

Basically is by by bringing a lot of like highly valuable scientific data. We can actually get a Revenue Code. So this is going to. Be one way. How we can actually create value for? 

The protocol and if you use that to basically subsidised further software development. 

And then in the future. There's going to be this possibility for. Scientists and people that actually. Want to put data on our network? They. Can make this decision. Between better, they want a story as a hot coffee or cold coffee cold coffee bowl. Either be extremely cheap or entirely free, and for hot copy there will be a data storage and data publication charge, but it will probably be about 30 or 40% less. 

OK.
