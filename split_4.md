I can see that that something I like what you've suggested. Would be, would would be a good idea but but but. It's it's, it's not, it's. In our in our. Area we're doing drop ship. Yeah, actually where it's supply, direct delivery. And so if there's a problem. You'd have to. You'd have to ship a replacement from from the supplier and and I guess you know that that is something that we could do, we could do again. 

Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

In terms of like an order or managing the information and then people can upload. 

Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a software as a service. So it's it's it's, yeah. 

Manage their supply chain. 

It it in in in most cases. 

The shared the operation status, state and VM. 

Yes, exactly. It's about Elizabeth. 

Yeah, exactly, exactly. 

And sometimes, OK, yeah. I'm not simple. E-mail with people about visibility with respect. Whether supplier and have the more incentive to. Operational better place. Just in case some people and. So that will remain. 

So so they. For example, they need to to they have a lead time, they need to dispatch by this leader. We're checking if they dispatch it and if they miss it then then they get a bad report, they get bad. 

Ohh I think. 

We are we are we. Are looking at the timestamp. 

I see I appliance service level agreement. 

Compliance. Yeah. So yeah. So if they delay. Then they will be they. They will be penalized. 

I see, I see and. Regardless the timing. 

The time is the. OK. And what we do is we just report, we report if it's late, we report it late. And and and that's, you know, it's and and people. Time is the supply. I can see the same data the retailer. 

I see that. 

So the supply is. In their interest. 

And they're very interested in improving the investment. 

Yeah, very good. 

Yeah, I will have so much. 

Yes, very efficient for insights on the first year student. So it really helped me save. A lot. All. 

Right. 

There you go. 

Thanks so much. 

Actually make it. 

Right. 

OK. 

So we have less money to spend. 

Right. 

Right. 

Right. 

Sorry about that. 

How are you? 

So I remember you registered as last mile. So one question about like there are a lot of other destinations. Are there any ways that we solutions? 

We don't do anything like that. I'm not aware. Of anything like. That, but there may be, but we don't. We don't have an answer to that, that we're mostly helping retailers fulfilled by store. Are you familiar with that kind of? 

Stuff. Yeah, it's like. 

So yeah, so traditionally they would ship from warehouses in the last few years, there was a big movement saying. That's not efficient. You have all these stores that have stock earnings of inventory. You should be including used warehouses and your stores. This place to ship for ecommerce, so we help them figure out the best. We use AI to help them figure out which store the most efficient way to get it there. And then on the. Turn we figure out based on the inventory and all the stores and warehouses where that return should go to have keep inventory ballast. 

Have you done anything?
